#Define the maze: First, you need to define the maze by representing it as a grid of cells. Each cell in the grid represents a location in the maze, and may be either a #wall or a pathway. Walls are represented as barriers that block movement, while pathways are represented as open spaces that allow movement.

#Define the starting and ending points: Next, you need to define the starting and ending points in the maze. The starting point is the location where the algorithm will #begin its search, and the ending point is the location where the algorithm will end its search.

#Implement a search algorithm: There are several search algorithms that can be used to solve mazes, such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search. #Choose an algorithm that best suits your needs and implement it.

#Traverse the maze: Once the search algorithm is implemented, traverse the maze by starting at the starting point and following the algorithm's instructions to find the #ending point. During traversal, the algorithm should keep track of the path it has taken and avoid backtracking.

#Output the solution: Once the ending point is reached, output the solution by displaying the path taken by the algorithm from the starting point to the ending point.

#Repeat for different mazes: Finally, we can repeat steps 1-5 for different mazes of different sizes and complexities.
